    <h1>About GitHub</h1>
    <div class="github">
        <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
        <p>GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software
            projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on
            open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site in which developers can openly network,
            collaborate, and pitch their work.
            <br>
            Since its founding in 2008, GitHub has acquired millions of users and established itself as a go-to platform
            for
            collaborative software projects. The service is free and comes with several helpful features for sharing
            code
            and working with others in real-time.
            <br>
            On top of its code-related functions, GitHub also encourages users to build a personal profile and brand for
            themselves. You can visit anyone’s profile and see what projects they own and contribute to. This makes
            GitHub a
            type of social network for programmers and fosters a collaborative approach to software and website
            development.

        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is open-source version control software, used for managing and tracking file revisions. It can be used
            with any file type, but is most often used for tracking code files. Git is the most widely used version
            control system in software development, and GitHub leverages this technology for its service, hence its
            name.
            <br>
            You’ve likely worked with some form of version control before. For example, Google Docs (as well as other
            Google Workspace tools) has a “Version History” tool where you can view changes to the document at different
            points in time. Microsoft Office has something similar with its “Track Changes” feature. Or, you might
            prefer saving multiple copies of a file and labeling them “v1”, “v2”, etc.
            <br>
            Advanced version control is necessary for software projects, especially collaborative ones. When building
            software, developers are frequently and simultaneously updating the code to add features and fix bugs. It
            wouldn’t make sense to make these changes to the source code directly, since any issues would affect users.
            Instead, developers work with their own copies of the code, then — after the code has been thoroughly tested
            — add this code to the main codebase.
            <br>
            That seems all well and good. But, with multiple contributors, things can get very messy very quickly if
            there’s no way to combine everyone’s contributions into one unified codebase or see who contributed what
            changes. These changes also must be tracked and stored in case something breaks and the developers need to
            backtrack and restore a previous version.
            <br>
            This is what Git is for. When a developer wants to make a change to the software, they download their own
            copy of the source code from its central storage location (called a repository, or “repo” for short) to
            their local system, make modifications safely to their own copy, then merge their revised copy back with the
            source files in the repository along with comments explaining the changes. Git tracks all of these
            modifications and stores previous versions as backups.
